% LaTeX introduction practical 1/2

% Dr. Noel Juvigny-Khenafou
% University of Koblenz-Landau, Winter semester 2021/22

% In this practical we will create a small LaTeX document to introduce the basic structure workflow.

% You first need to define the type of document that you are writing. Every LaTeX document start with the same workflow.


% in our case we take the example of a manuscript article but many other types exist. In the next practical we will look at a CV for instance.

\documentclass[11pt, a4paper]{article}

% this is a command line. It starts with a name, i.e. "\documentclass" followed by the required argument between curly brackets {  }
% we can also add optional argument within normal brackets [ ] between the name and required argument. Optional argument can be
% removed of course. 

% \name[optional argument]{required argument}

% at this stage we can define all the characteristics of the document that we want such as the font size, font type, margins etc...

% we then can define the title of the document as well as the date and authors etc...

\title{My introduction to LaTeX}
\author{My name}
\date{Today's date}

% the next step in the preparation of the document is to load all the packages that we will be using to add functionality with the
% " \usepackage" command

% first we can load a package to specify we want an English hyphenation.

\usepackage[english]{babel}

% we can then add a package to choose the font that we want. Here we set to Helvetica but other font package exists.

\usepackage{helvet}

% we then add a package to improve the justification of the text document wide.

\usepackage{microtype}

% a package to add figures to the text

\usepackage {graphicx}
\graphicspath{ {images/} } % You need to create an "images" folder first and then you can upload the images you need to it.


% we use this package to chose the encoding of the file; utf8 is recommended.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}


% all the different steps made to define the attribute of our document is what we call the "preamble"
% Now that we have added all the package we want we are ready to add our text in what is called the "body"

\begin{document} % command line to open the document
\maketitle % this command is to print the titles and other attribute we set up

We have now created our first little LaTeX document.

\end{document} % command line to close the document

%run "recompile" and see your document appear before your eyes!

% Now we will take this template and improve it to add new features. You can find the edits in the next practical file.
