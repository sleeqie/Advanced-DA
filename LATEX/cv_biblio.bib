abstract = {Sustainable management of freshwater and pesticide use is essential for mitigating the impacts of intensive agriculture in the context of a changing climate. To better understand how climate change will affect the vulnerability of freshwater ecosystems to chemical pollutants, more empirical evidence is needed on the combined effects of climatic and chemical stressors in environmentally realistic conditions. Our experiment provides the first empirical evaluation of stream macroinvertebrate community dynamics in response to one of the world's most widely used insecticides, imidacloprid, and increased water temperature. In a 7-week streamside experiment using 128 flow-through circular mesocosms, we investigated the effects of pulsed imidacloprid exposure (four environmentally relevant levels between 0 and 4.6 µg/L) and raised water temperature (ambient, 3°C above) on invertebrate communities representative of fast- and slow-flowing microhabitats. Invertebrate drift and insect emergence were monitored during three pesticide pulses (10 days apart), and benthic invertebrate communities were sampled after 24 days of heating and pesticide manipulations. All three manipulated factors strongly affected drift community composition. The first imidacloprid pulse and increased temperature had a greater impact on communities in fast-flowing mesocosms, which contained more pollution-sensitive EPT taxa (mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies). Heating and imidacloprid caused increased emigration by drift, weak reductions in emergence, and negatively affected the benthic community. The combined effect of stressor manipulations and a 10-day natural heatwave drastically reduced relative abundances of EPT and insects overall and caused a shift to oligochaete-, crustacean- and gastropod-dominated communities. Contrary to our hypothesis, the very high yet realistic water temperatures reached in our experiment meant the negative effects of imidacloprid were clearest at ambient temperatures and fast flow. These findings demonstrate the potential combined impacts of imidacloprid contamination and heatwaves on freshwater invertebrate communities under future climate scenarios and highlight the need for more countries to take regulatory action to control neonicotinoid use.},

abstract = {Despite the progress made in environmental microbiology techniques and knowledge, the succession and functional changes of the microbial community under multiple stressors are still poorly understood. This is a substantial knowledge gap as microbial communities regulate the biogeochemistry of stream ecosystems. Our study assessed the structural and temporal changes in stream fungal and bacterial communities associated with decomposing leaf litter under a multiple-stressor scenario. We conducted a fully crossed 4-factor experiment in 64 flow-through mesocosms fed by a pristine montane stream (21 days of colonisation, 21 days of manipulations) and investigated the effects of nutrient enrichment, flow velocity reduction and sedimentation after 2 and 3 weeks of stressor exposure. We used high-throughput sequencing and metabarcoding techniques (16S and 18S rRNA genes) to identify changes in microbial community composition. Our results indicate that (1) shifts in relative abundances of the pre-existing terrestrial microbial community, rather than changes in community identity, drove the observed responses to stressors; (2) changes in relative abundances within the microbial community paralleled decomposition rate patterns with time; (3) both fungal and bacterial communities had a certain resistance to stressors, as indicated by relatively minor changes in alpha diversity or multivariate community structure; (4) overall, stressor interactions were more common than stressor main effects when affecting microbial diversity metrics or abundant individual genera; and (5) stressor effects on microbes often changed from 2 weeks to 3 weeks of stressor exposure, with several response patterns being reversed. Our study suggests that future research should focus more on understanding the temporal dynamics of fungal and bacterial communities and how they relate to ecosystem processes to advance our understanding of the mechanisms associated with multiple-stressor interactions.},

abstract = {Abstract Freshwater ecosystems face many simultaneous pressures due to human activities. Consequently, there has been a rapid loss of freshwater biodiversity and an increase in biomonitoring programs. Our study assessed the potential of benthic stream bacterial communities as indicators of multiple-stressor impacts associated with urbanisation and agricultural intensification. We conducted a fully crossed 4-factor experiment in 64 flow-through mesocosms fed by a pristine montane stream (21 days of colonisation, 21 days of manipulations) and investigated the effects of nutrient enrichment, flow velocity reduction and added fine sediment after 2 and 3 weeks of stressor exposure. We used high-throughput sequencing and metabarcoding techniques (16S rRNA genes), as well as curated biological databases (METAGENassit, MetaCyc), to identify changes in bacterial relative abundances and predicted metabolic functional profile. Sediment addition and flow velocity reduction were the most pervasive stressors. Both increased $\alpha$-diversity and had strong, taxon-specific effects on community composition and predicted functions. Sediment and flow velocity also interacted frequently, with 88{\%} of all bacterial response variables showing 2-way interactions and 33{\%} showing 3-way interactions including nutrient enrichment. Changes in relative abundances of common taxa were associated with shifts in dominant predicted functions, which can be extrapolated to underlaying stream-wide mechanisms such as carbon use and bacterial energy production pathways. Observed changes were largely stable over time and occurred after just 2 weeks of exposure, demonstrating that bacterial communities can be well-suited for early detection of multiple stressors. Overall, added sediment and reduced flow velocity impacted both bacterial community structure and predicted function more than nutrient enrichment. In future research and stream management, a holistic approach to studying multiple-stressor impacts should include multiple trophic levels with their functional responses, to enhance our mechanistic understanding of complex stressor effects and promote establishment of more efficient biomonitoring programs.},

abstract = {Ensuring the provision of essential ecosystem services in systems affected by multiple stressors is a key challenge for theoretical and applied ecology. Trait-based approaches have increasingly been used in multiple-stressor research in freshwaters because they potentially provide a powerful method to explore the mechanisms underlying changes in populations and communities. Individual benthic macroinvertebrate traits associated with mobility, life history, morphology, and feeding habits are often used to determine how environmental drivers structure stream communities. However, to date multiple-stressor research on stream invertebrates has focused more on taxonomic than on functional metrics. We conducted a fully crossed, 4-factor experiment in 64 stream mesocosms fed by a pristine montane stream (21 days of colonization, 21 days of manipulations) and investigated the effects of nutrient enrichment, flow velocity reduction and sedimentation on invertebrate community, taxon, functional diversity and trait variables after 2 and 3 weeks of stressor exposure. 89{\%} of the community structure metrics, 59{\%} of the common taxa, 50{\%} of functional diversity metrics, and 79{\%} of functional traits responded to at least one stressor each. Deposited fine sediment and flow velocity reduction had the strongest impacts, affecting invertebrate abundances and diversity, and their effects translated into a reduction of functional redundancy. Stressor effects often varied between sampling occasions, further complicating the prediction of multiple-stressor effects on communities. Overall, our study suggests that future research combining community, trait, and functional diversity assessments can improve our understanding of multiple-stressor effects and their interactions in running waters.},
